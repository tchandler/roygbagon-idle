* gh-pages build
* Show most recent ship amount
* Balance shipment error percent
* More granular rendering (don't re-render the whole thing every time)
  * Might consider a framework, probably something lighter than react
* Purchasable items
  * See sum of colors in target
    * 10k, permanent upgrade?
  * Individual channel "weights"
    * Percentages? Exclusive?
    * Purchasable per target, more cost per channel reveal
      * E.g. 100 to reveal first channel, 1000 for second?
* Targets
  * Multiple targets, choose which to ship to
  * Targets have time limits, will expire
    * Letting targets expire reduces shipping multiplyer?
