UX:
  * Rules! Rendered w/ Config 
Tech:
  * More granular rendering (don't re-render the whole thing every time)
    * Might consider a framework, probably something lighter than react
  * Dev ui with sliders/inputs to change balances/restart game
Game:
  * Dynamic pricing?
    * Change prices per target? Per color?
      * Maybe track over-shipped colors and reduce their value generally?
  * Purchasable items
    * See sum of colors in target
      * 10k, permanent upgrade?
    * Individual channel "weights"
      * Percentages? Exclusive?
      * Purchasable per target, more cost per channel reveal
        * E.g. 100 to reveal first channel, 1000 for second?
  * Targets
    * Multiple targets, choose which to ship to
    * Targets have time limits, will expire
      * Letting targets expire reduces shipping multiplyer?
